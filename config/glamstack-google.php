    /**
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Connections Configuration
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * To allow for least privilege access and multiple API keys, the SDK uses
     * this configuration section for configuring each of the API keys that
     * you use and configuring the different API Scopes for each token, as well
     * as any other optional variables that are needed for any specific Google
     * API endpoints.
     *
     * Each connection has an array key that we refer to as the "connection key"
     * that contains a array of configuration values and is used when the SDK
     * for the respective service ApiClient is instantiated.
     *
     * ```php
     * $google_auth = new \Glamstack\GoogleWorkspace\ApiClient('workspace');
     * ```
     *
     * You can add the `GOOGLE_AUTH_DEFAULT_CONNECTION` variable in your .env
     * file so you don't need to pass the connection key into the ApiClient.
     * The `workspace` connection key is used if the `.env` variable is not set.
     *
     * ```php
     * $google_auth = new \Glamstack\GoogleWorkspace\ApiClient();
     * ```
     *
     * The JSON API key file that you generate and download should be added to
     * your locally cloned repository in the `storage/keys/google-auth/sdk`
     * directory with the filename that matches the connection key.
     * `storage/keys/google-auth-sdk/workspace.json`
     *
     * On your production web/app server, this should be added to
     * this directory using infrastructure-as-code automation (ex. Ansible).
     *
     * You should never commit this JSON file to your Git repository since this
     * exposes your credentials, and the `storage/keys/` directory must be
     * added to your `.gitignore` file.
     *
     * By default the SDK will use configuration for the connection_key
     * `workspace`, unless you override this in your `.env` file using
     * the `GOOGLE_AUTH_DEFAULT_CONNECTION` variable, or pass the connection
     * key as an argument when using the `ApiClient`.
     *
     * The list of OAUTH scopes for Google APIs can be found in the docs.
     * See the `README.md` for more instructions and security practices
     * for using scopes with your service account JSON keys.
